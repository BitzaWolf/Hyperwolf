# Hyperwolf
This is the publically available code for the indie game Hyperwolf!

Hyperwolf is a runner-puzzler that is still in development.

This repo acts as a place to showcase the code written to run the game. Source Unity project assets will _not_ be available because it is a commerical game. The only reason the code is here is for anyone interested in exploring my work or how the game runs.
